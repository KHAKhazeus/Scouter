SCOUT: 2 Player Rules (Oink Version)
• The two player game lasts only 2 rounds
• Setup
o Remove the (1) 9/10 card from the deck
o Deal 11 cards to each player for the first round and set the remaining 22 cards aside
▪ These 22 cards will be dealt out for the second round
o Each player receives 3 Scout chips, Scout & Show chips are not used in the 2 player
game
• The first turn is played like normal, the first player must Show
• Subsequent turns
o A player will Scout or Show on their turn like normal except that when a player takes
the Scout action they must spend 1 of their 3 Scout chips to do so
▪ This chip is put into the center of the board
▪ Unlike the 3-5 player game, the opposing player DOES NOT receive a Scout
chip even though they own the Active Set
o The same player must continue to take successive turns until they either Show or can
no longer Scout because they have run out of Scout chips
▪ This means the same player may take multiple turns before the opposing
player takes another turn
▪ A player may not refuse to Scout to conserve chips, they must continue taking
concurrent turns until they can either Show or have run out of Scout chips
• The round ends when either:
o A player has no cards left in their hand after they take a Show action
o On a player’s turn they are unable to Show AND they have run out of Scout chips and
therefore cannot take another Scout action
• Scoring is the same as the 3-5 player game except players will receive 1 VP for each remaining
Scout chip they have not spent at the end of the round (a maximum of 3 points).
